  - WHEREAS i want all my gem dependencies local to the app, and never to involve any external gems or other fuckery
  - WHEREAS i dont know how to do that really but i think it can be done
  - WHEREAS this blog post was seen: http://ryan.mcgeary.org/2011/02/09/vendor-everything-still-applies/
    - HEREBY i cd'd into src/
    - I created a Gemfile (empty) 
    - I ran 'bundle install --path vendor'
    - I ran 'echo 'vendor/ruby' >> .gitignore'
    - I ran 'bundle package'
    - I hoped that was all I needed, but if so why in the FUCK is that so hard to learn from bundler's web site? Seems unlikely.
