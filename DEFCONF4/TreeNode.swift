// This is essentially a Swift port, with some re-thinking, of: NakaharaTreeNode.m (2008)
//
// Something like NSTreeNode without being Mac-specific or *requiring* AppKit .
//
// The purpose is to create a generic interface that may be implemented by any object, and which gives our UI classes (like table controllers in Touch/Cocoa/other) enough data to do their job of displaying tree-like lists (filesystem hierarchy, preference settings, address book, etc etc) without knowing about the objects themselves. My current thinking is that WRAPPING every object all the time is too much hassle (although it does work when need be), but making model objects SUBCLASS a tree node primitive object is also unacceptably kludgey, so this is the only practical way to accomplish my goal. It is still a little bit clunkorama to make simple-ass model objects implement all these methods, but it is the best idea I can come up with (Mason Tue, Jun 10, 2008)
